# Creating Extension Icons

The extension requires icon files at:
- `public/icons/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `public/icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `public/icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor. For a quick solution:

1. Create a simple icon design (e.g., a YouTube play button or thumbnail icon)
2. Export it in the three required sizes
3. Save them as PNG files in the `public/icons/` directory

Alternatively, you can use online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://favicon.io/

The icons are currently placeholders. Replace them with actual PNG files before building the extension.
